# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Manual Character Creation**: Added option to create a character with completely empty and editable fields
  - Two creation modes available: Automatic (generates random values) and Manual (empty form)
  - In Automatic mode: Name, Background, and Birthsign fields are read-only after generation, while Stats (STR, DEX, WIL, HP) are read-only. All fields can still be modified but with restrictions.
  - In Manual mode: All fields (Name, Background, Birthsign, Stats) are fully editable from the start
  - Character creation method is tracked and influences field editability across the character sheet
